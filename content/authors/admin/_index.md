I'm an Assistant Professor at Bocconi University. Prior to this role, I spent a year as a Postdoctoral Researcher in France at HEC Paris. I hold a PhD in Quantitative Marketing from the University of Mannheim.

My multi-method research projects cover social influence in user-generated content networks–combining both secondary and experimental data. My research interests meet at the interface of empirical quantitative marketing and information systems. Specifically, I research sales-driven influencer marketing and its impact on society.
